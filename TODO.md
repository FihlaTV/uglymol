- It would nice to calculate maps from a reflection file (mtz)
  in the browser, but currently no one is working on it. Volunteers needed.
  Requires 3D FFT.

- atom labels

- use UMD format for built files. Maybe use rollupjs
  if https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/9310 gets merged.

- a few more keybindings:
  L = next ligand (ctrl-L in coot),
  u = move back to old centre,
  Ctrl-G - go to specified residue

- impostor-based ball and stick mode
