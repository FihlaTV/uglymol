These differences from coot are intentional, but again, feedback is welcome
and we are quite flexible.

* Sulphur is more green - it is hardly different from yellow C in coot.

* Coot has colors only for H, C, N, O and S - all the rest is in the same
  default color. We also set colors for Mg, P, Cl, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni.

* Middle mouse button - centering on atom is performed when the mouse button
  is released (in coot - when it is pressed), and only if you do not move
  the mouse when the button is pressed. Otherwise it is interpreted as panning.

* Since Ctrl-R is reloading page we use Shift-I for "rocking".
